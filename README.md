# neo-ng

This is a mono repo for my personal Angular projects.
I also use it to dive deep into Angular Web Framework.
Planning to make some of reusable libraries in the future.

## TODO

- [ ] Research why in the new `Angular v17`, the hot loading only work once ??
- [ ] Setup prettier and pre-hook push with husky ?
- [ ] Research how to do base `scss` and setup for big projects
- [ ] Research how to create a button with ripple directive (ref: angular material)
- [ ] Research how to create custom icons pack library
